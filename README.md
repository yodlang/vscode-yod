## Features

- Syntax highlighting
- Formatting
- Parsing
- Helpful error messages

## Usage

The expected file extension of the Yod programming language is `.yod`.

You will only need to have the Yod executable either in your PATH, or pointed by the `yod.executablePath` setting, for the formatting to work as the default formatter setting is already configured for you.

## Installation

1. Download [the latest VSIX](https://github.com/yodlang/vscode-yod/releases/latest)
2. In the extensions tab of Visual Studio Code, from the three dots, click on “Install from VSIX…”
3. Select the VSIX file you have just downloaded

The extension is now installed.
